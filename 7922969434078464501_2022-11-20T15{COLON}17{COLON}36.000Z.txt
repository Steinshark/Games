@HatR09 @BlackKnight10k Mmm… ok, but at least I have a profile bio. 🤷🏻‍♀️ And apparently you do care or you wouldn’t take the time to 1) go to my bio, 2) screenshot it, 3) tell me how much you don’t care. 

So why DO you care so much that I don’t want to buy a car from a business owner I don’t respect?
