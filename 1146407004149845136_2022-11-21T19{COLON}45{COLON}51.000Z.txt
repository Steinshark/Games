@RegretteRuane @PermaHeretic I was happier about instagram until today, when a company reached out to me because they like my work, which I know should be v.v. positive if not scam but I don't know how to tell &amp; so my 'climb metaphoric tree' gene has activated. Their email language is cooler than mine.
