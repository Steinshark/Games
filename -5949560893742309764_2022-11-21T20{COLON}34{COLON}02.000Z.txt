@silent_lasagna6 @MikeKilli Coaches should be made to watch 4th quarter of Ohio State v. Penn State to learn football is an emotional game. Kosar knew if you got a TD, then INT 2 plays later, you go for the throat on next play. Stefankski looks at analytic menu and goes, "Hmmm, 1st down on opponents 39."
