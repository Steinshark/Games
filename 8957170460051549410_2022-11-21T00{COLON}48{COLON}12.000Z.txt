@sstrazza @EROCK912 Thanks Steven, I primarily trade SPY, TSLA and AAPL. With CAT, Iâ€™m curious if strong dollar propels their SP while the general market suffers. Also, is the gap and 200 ema a target that could fill if SPY revisited 370 range before EOY or is Feb. or March 2023 more realistic? Tks
