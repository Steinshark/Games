@NinaWilsonStats @Xenosbreed @Spare130198 @DrProudman No, when it comes to v public spaces we have to learn to get comfortable minding our own business. Addressing behaviour &amp; not "deviant based on appearance." Tbqh if you're in a public washroom &amp; u see someone you don't like the look of, the adult thing to do is mind ur business.
