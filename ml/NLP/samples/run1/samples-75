This morning after breakfast I took the garbage can to the road and on the way back fell on the ice.  A neighbor saw me and got me up. 

I believe it was in October 1998 and I was in Peru for 32 + years.  Thanks Tom and Janice.

I am fine with whatever you decide about life in this little place.  We love you, Mom/Nana.

Tom and Janice Zdrazil were just out at the grocery store in Philadelphia.  Uncle Doug was in Peru
