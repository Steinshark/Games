 Wax in his hand, and I went.

There you have it. What a wonderful day to be a New Yorker. I am very thankful that you have enjoyed the beauty of the New York landscape. I have many many memories of you as our young children.

Love you too.

May you all enjoy this wonderful day.

We pray for you tonight.
