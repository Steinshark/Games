It was dark and at times rainy on the way home.  We are expecting an overnight guest from Park Rapids momentarily - Craig Clark.   Craig has heart issues and will need hospitalization when he gets home.   He did get his ambulance out on the 9th but it did not have the capacity to take him.  We are talking much to nurses, social workers etc. since many of us are local.   Hope Sharalyn and her family follow suit and I will have time to do laundry, cooking (more so now) and more.
